## Meet Me
Good day. I'm Ehi. I'm an aspiring developer from Edo, Nigeria. I took this challenge. Here's how I did it and thanks for reading!

## My process
After my HTML, I start styling with padding. I set the margin of all elements to zero and then give all elements borders. This helps me visualize all element boundaries - all this I do without adding any color.

Then, I add color, backgrounds and border radii to the assigned elements. I prefer using Comic Sans MS as my font because it feels relaxing to my eyes and it helps me think better. I can't explain it though, it's just a feeling.

Funny and weird, right?üòÅ

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I've learned how to animate the detail elements and target the open state of the details tag.

```css
details::details-content {
    display: block;
    block-size: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    transition-property: block-size;
    transition-duration: .5s;
    transition-behavior: allow-discrete;
}
details[open]::details-content {
    block-size: auto;
    block-size: calc-size(auto);
}
```
It was really fun!

### Continued development
I want to do better at positioning next time. I need all the help I can get with that.

I also need help suggestions on how to do better at the pattern-image part of the the challenge.

## Acknowledgments
I really want to thank Kevin powell on his video which taught me a great deal on how to customise details and summary tags. Thanks to CSS weekly for also teaching me how to animate them too. Thanks guys.
